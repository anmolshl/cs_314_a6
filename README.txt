- Questions a-d done as directed in the assignment specification sheet.

- For question e, I added a fourth blue sphere in the fragment shader code with
Phong-Blinn Shading. All varying and uniform variables used are defined in the
fragment and vertex shaders. There is a "mode" uniform variable which is passed
from the javascript side. It has four values (1, 2, 3, 4) used to switch between
different modes of phong shading (mentioned in comments in Phong Shading code)
